# Welcome to in5

**Secure your development environment in 5 minutes or less.**

## The in5 Initiative

The **in5** initiative is a collection of open-source tools and best practices designed to help developers secure their development environments quickly and effectively. We believe that security should be accessible to everyone, not just security experts.

Our goal is to provide tools that:

- Get you secure in 5 minutes or less
- Address real-world security challenges
- Are easy to understand and use
- Follow best practices in cybersecurity

## Why in5?

In today's rapidly evolving threat landscape, developers face numerous security challenges:

- **Credential leakage**: Accidentally committing API keys or passwords to public repositories
- **Environment inconsistencies**: Different security configurations across development, testing, and production
- **Insecure defaults**: Many tools come with insecure default settings
- **Complexity**: Security tools are often difficult to set up and use

The **in5** initiative aims to address these challenges by providing simple, effective tools that can be implemented quickly, making security accessible to all developers regardless of their security expertise.

## Our Tools

Currently, the **in5** initiative includes:

- [**imbued**](/docs/tools/imbued): A tool that dynamically manages environment variables based on your current directory, enhancing security by isolating sensitive data.

We're continuously working on new tools to address various security challenges. Our roadmap includes tools for:

- Secure secret management
- Local development environment hardening
- Automated security scanning
- Secure configuration management

## Getting Started
