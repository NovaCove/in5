# in5 - Secure Your Environment in 5 Minutes

The **in5** initiative is a collection of open-source tools and best practices designed to help developers secure their development environments quickly and effectively. We believe that security should be accessible to everyone, not just security experts.

This repository contains the website for the in5 initiative, built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Our Mission

Our goal is to provide tools that:

- Can be set up in 5 minutes or less
- Address real-world security challenges
- Are easy to understand and use
- Follow best practices in cybersecurity

## Featured Tools

- **imbued**: A tool that dynamically manages environment variables based on your current directory, enhancing security by isolating sensitive data and preventing accidental exposure.

## Website

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

For manual deployment:

```bash
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```
